# Databases and SQL

## Overview

Understanding databases is crucial for managing and analyzing data. This section covers relational database concepts, SQL commands, and database management.

## Main Concepts

- **Relational Database Management**: Understanding tables, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- **SQL Commands**: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`.
- **Large Repositories of data**: Techniques for identifying, selecting, extracting, and validating data.

## Databases in the Study Design

### Unit 3 Outcome 1

**Key Knowledge:**

- structural characteristics of relational database management systems (RDBMS), including:
  - data types and field sizes
  - data in tables
  - relationships using primary and foreign key fields
  - use of SQL to generate queries
- techniques for identifying, selecting, extracting and validating authentic data stored in large repositories, including:
  - downloading datasets in a range of formats
  - the use of SQL functions to retrieve, filter, sort and link dataset values (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, INNER JOIN)
  - the use of Boolean operators (AND, NOT, OR) for WHERE statements
  - existence checking, type checking and range checking
- techniques for testing databases and spreadsheets, including:
  - testing formula and query results
  - testing validation
  - test cases comparing expected and actual results in testing tables

**Key Skills:**

- identify, select, extract and validate relevant data from large repositories using database software

## Relational Database Management

### What is a database?

A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. **Relational Databases** are databases that model the data in tables with rows and columns. Each **table** represents an entity, and each **row** represents a record. The **columns** represent attributes or fields. In relational databases, tables are linked using foreign key to primary key relationships.

### Primary Key and Foreign Key Relationships

A **primary key** is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot be NULL. A **foreign key** is a field in a table that links to the primary key in another table. This establishes a relationship between those two tables.

For example, in an `employees` table, the `employee_id` could be the primary key. In a `departments` table, the `department_id` could be the primary key. If each employee belongs to a department, the `department_id` in the `employees` table would be a foreign key linking to the `department_id` in the `departments` table.

This means that we can retrieve all the information about each employees department (location, department name, phone number, manager, etc.) without needing to rewrite that information for each employee in the department. This is an important feature of relational databases.

## SQL

**SQL** *(Structured Query Language)* is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is used to perform tasks such as querying data, updating data, and creating databases and tables. While most database systems have tiny differences in their implementation of SQL, it is almost entirely standardized across platforms.

SQL allows you to perform a wide range of operations on a database, including selecting data, aggregating data, updating data, and deleting data from database tables. The SQL commands we study in Data Analytics are:

- `SELECT`: Retrieve data from a database
- `FROM`: Specify the table to retrieve data from
- `WHERE`: Filter data based on a condition
- `JOIN`: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them
- `ORDER BY`: Sort the result set in ascending or descending order
- `GROUP BY`: Group rows that have the same values into summary rows
- `INSERT`: Insert new records into a table
- `UPDATE`: Modify existing records in a table
- `DELETE`: Remove records from a table

Some additional commands that are useful to learn are:

- `CREATE TABLE`: Create a new table in the database
- `ALTER TABLE`: Modify an existing table in the database
- `DROP TABLE`: Delete a table from the database
- `CREATE SEQUENCE`: Create a sequence in the database
- `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`: Aggregate functions for summarizing data
- `HAVING`: Filter data after grouping has been performed

### SQL Syntax

`SELECT` statements are the most common SQL commands. The basic syntax for a `SELECT` statement is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

This statement selects the specific columns (from the column list) from the table (specified by `table_name`) where the condition is true. The `WHERE` clause is optional, but it is used to filter the rows returned by the query.

## SQL Joins

**Joins** are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of joins:

- `INNER JOIN`**`: Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
- `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`): Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table.
- `RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`): Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table.
- `FULL JOIN` (or `FULL OUTER JOIN`): Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

In Data Analytics we primarily focus on `INNER JOIN` to combine rows from two tables where there is a match between the columns in both tables.

### SQL Join Example

Consider two tables, `employees` and `departments`, with the following columns:

`employees` table:

- `employee_id`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `department_id`

`departments` table:

- `department_id`
- `department_name`
- `location`

To retrieve the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department_name` of each employee, you could use an `INNER JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### Data Types in SQL

SQL supports a variety of data types, including:

- `INTEGER`: A whole number
- `DECIMAL`: A fixed-point number
- `VARCHAR(n)`: A variable-length string with a maximum length of `n` (sometimes just called `TEXT`)
- `DATE`: A date value
- `TIME`: A time value
- `BOOLEAN`: A true/false value

Data types are especially important in SQL because they help ensure data integrity and accuracy. Databases will not allow data to be saved in a table unless the data type matches the column definition. This helps prevent errors and ensures that the data is consistent, but it also means that databases need to be carefully designed.

### SQL Query Examples

#### Select all columns from students where their age is equal to 17

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = 17;
```

#### Select the name and age columns from students and order them by age in descending order

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;
```

#### Insert a new student into the students table

```sql
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, age, year_level) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 17, 11);
```

#### Update a specific student's year level

```sql
UPDATE students SET year_level = 12 WHERE student_id = 131;
```

#### Create a new table

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    age INTEGER
);
```
