## APA Referencing

APA referencing is a widely used system for acknowledging sources in academic writing. It provides a consistent format for citing and referencing sources, making it easier for readers to locate the original sources.

### In-Text Citations

In-text citations are used to acknowledge sources within the text of your work. They include the author's last name and the publication year. For example:

- (Smith, 2019)
- (Jones & Brown, 2020)
- (Johnson et al., 2018)

### Reference List

The reference list is a list of all the sources you have cited in your work. It is placed at the end of your document and provides detailed information about each source. The format for different types of sources (e.g., books, journal articles, websites) is standardized.

#### Example of a Book Reference

Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work: Capital letter also for subtitle*. Publisher.

- Smith, J. (2017). *Data Science for Beginners*. Data Science Press.
- Jones, R., & Brown, S. (2020). *The Ethics of Data Collection*. Academic Press.
- Johnson, M., Lee, K., & White, L. (2018). *Data Privacy and Security: The Ongoing Battle*. Springer.

#### Example of a Journal Article Reference

Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical, volume number*(issue number), pages.
