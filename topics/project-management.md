# Project Management Strategies

## Overview

![Project Management Image - Created by ChatGPT4o/Dall-E](/assets/images/projectmanagement.png)

Effective project management is essential for delivering successful data projects. This section covers planning techniques, Gantt charts, and tracking progress. Lots of our focus for the project management is on tracking the progress of our SAT project and associated tasks.

## Key Concepts

- **Gantt Charts**: Visualizing tasks and timelines.
- **Milestones**: Setting key goals and deadlines.
- **Critical Path**: Identifying the tasks which can run concurrently and which tasks will delay the whole project if they are delayed themselves. The critical path is the set of tasks which will delay the whole project if they are delayed
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating project risks.

## Project Management in the Study Design

### Unit 3 Outcome 2

**Key Knowledge:**

- features of project management to develop a project plan using Gantt charts, including:
  - identification of tasks
  - sequencing of tasks
  - time allocation
  - dependencies
  - milestones
  - critical path
  - monitoring and documenting the progress of projects

**Key Skills:**

- create, monitor and modify project plans using software

### Unit 4 Outcome 1

**Key Knowledge:**

- techniques for recording the progress of projects, including:
  - adjustments to tasks
  - adjustments to time frames
  - annotations to project plans
  - monitoring and documenting progress using logs/journals
- techniques for assessing the effectiveness of a project plan, including:
  - reviewing the number of changes made to the project plan during the project
  - the reason changes were necessary
  - the impact of changes on the completion of the project.

**Key Skills:**

-	monitor, modify and annotate project plans as necessary
- assess the effectiveness of the project plan
