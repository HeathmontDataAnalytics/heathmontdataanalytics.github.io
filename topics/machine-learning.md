# Machine Learning & AI

## Overview

Machine learning allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This section explores basic ML concepts, algorithms, and applications in data analysis.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**: Understanding different types of learning.
- **Common Algorithms**: Linear regression, decision trees, and clustering.
- **Applications of ML in Data Analytics**: Predictive modeling, data classification.

## Learning Resources

- [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

## Example Exercises

### Exercise 1: Building a Linear Regression Model

- Use Excel or Google Sheets to create a simple linear regression model.

### Exercise 2: Clustering with K-Means

- Explore clustering techniques using a small dataset in Python or Excel.
