# Machine Learning and AI

## Overview

Machine learning allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This section explores basic ML concepts, algorithms, and applications in data analysis. In Data Analytics we look at artificial intelligence as a software feature for
analysing data, as well as using machine learning for making predictions or recommendations. AI is also part of our study of
cyber security and ethical issues.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**: Understanding different types of learning.
- **Common Algorithms**: Linear regression, decision trees, and clustering.
- **AI in protecting data**: ways AI tools can be used to protect data integrity
- **Ethical use of data in AI**: understanding the ethical issues posed by large machine-learning models' use of data,
including data that may be copyrighted.
