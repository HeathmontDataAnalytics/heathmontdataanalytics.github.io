# Spreadsheets & Data Cleansing

## Overview

Spreadsheets are powerful tools for data analysis and management. This section focuses on using spreadsheet functions for calculations, data analysis, and data cleansing.

## Key Concepts

- **Spreadsheet Functions**: Formulas, functions (e.g., `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `IF`), sorting, and filtering.
- **Data Cleansing Techniques**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and validation rules.

## Spreadsheets and Data Cleansing in the Study Design

### Unit 3 Outcome 1

**Key Knowledge:**

- design tools for representing databases and spreadsheets, including: 
  - data dictionaries
  - query designs
  - layout diagrams
  - input-process-output (IPO) charts
- techniques for effectively and efficiently manipulating and cleansing data, including:
  - formulas and functions to perform calculations
  - sorting, filtering and reformatting
  - identifying and fixing errors
- techniques to statistically analyse data to identify trends, relationships and patterns, including:
  - descriptive statistics (average, median, minimum, maximum, range, standard deviation, count/frequency, sum)
  - Pearson’s correlation co-efficient (r)
  - the shape and skew of data
- techniques for testing databases and spreadsheets, including:
  - testing formula and query results
  - testing validation
  - test cases comparing expected and actual results in testing tables

  **Key Skills:**
  - manipulate and cleanse data using spreadsheet software
  - develop and apply suitable testing techniques to software tools used

### Unit 4 Outcome 1

**Key Knowledge:**

- effective and efficient methods to manipulate data using software tools, including:
  - software functions
- techniques for analysing data to refine findings for data visualisations, including:
  - descriptive statistics (average, median, minimum, maximum, range, standard deviation, count/frequency, sum)
  - Pearson’s correlation co-efficient (r)
  - the shape and skew of data

**Key Skills:**

- conduct statistical analysis to identify trends, relationships and patterns

## Example Exercises

### Exercise 1: Using Functions

- Calculate the average score of students in a class.

```excel
=AVERAGE(B2:B20)
```

### Exercise 2: Data Validation

- Set up a drop-down list for a column to ensure consistent data entry.
- Use conditional formatting to highlight any outliers
