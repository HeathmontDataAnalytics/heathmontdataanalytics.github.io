# Data Collection Methods

## Overview

Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system, which then enables one to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes. Data collection is a fundamental aspect of research, and it is important to understand the methods used to collect data. This article will discuss the various methods of data collection, including primary and secondary data collection methods.

## Primary and Secondary Data

In Data Analytics we separate the data we collect into two categories: primary data and secondary data. Whether a given data collection is primary or secondary depends on how the data was collected. Data that is collected **by the researcher(s) themselves** is primary data, while data that was **collected by someone else** is secondary data.

### Primary Data Collection Methods

Primary data collection methods are those methods that are used to collect data directly from the source. These methods are used when the data needed is not already available. The most common primary data collection methods are:

1. **Surveys**: Surveys are a popular method of primary data collection. Surveys can be conducted in person, over the phone, through the mail, or online. Surveys have the advantage of being able to collect data from a large number of people in a relatively short amount of time. 

2. **Interviews**: Interviews are another common method of primary data collection. Interviews can be conducted in person, over the phone, or through video conferencing. Interviews can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, depending on the research question.

3. **Observations**: Observations are a method of primary data collection that involves watching and recording behavior.

### Secondary Data

Secondary data is not necessarily any less valuable than primary data. In fact, secondary data often allows a researcher to make use of data that would be impossible to collect otherwise. The most common sources of secondary data are:

1. **Government Data**: Government data is a valuable source of secondary data. Government agencies collect a wide range of data on a variety of topics, and this data is often freely available to the public.

2. **Online Data Repositories**: There are many online data repositories that provide access to a wide range of data sets.

3. **Academic Journals**: Academic journals are another valuable source of secondary data. Many academic journals publish data sets along with their articles, and these data sets are often freely available to the public.
