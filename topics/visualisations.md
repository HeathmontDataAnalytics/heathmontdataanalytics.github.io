Data visualisation helps convey complex information clearly. This section covers types of visualisations, best practices, and how to use tools like Matplotlib or Plotly to create visualisations from data, showcasing our results in Streamlit. You will learn about the purposes of data visualisations, design tools, and formats to improve their effectiveness for intended users.

## Data Visualisations in the Study Design

### Unit 3 Outcome 1

**Key Knowledge:**

- emerging trends in data analytics using artificial intelligence, including:
  - generating data visualisations through the writing and refinement of prompts
- purposes of data visualisations, including:
  - exploratory data analysis
  - presentation of information
  - providing interactive experiences for users to explore data
- types of data visualisations, including:
  - infographics (series or long-form, static)
  - dashboards (interactive, static or live data)
  - dynamic data visualisations (interactive, live data)
- design tools for representing data visualisations, including:
  - mock-ups
  - storyboards
- formats and conventions applied to data visualisations to improve their effectiveness for intended users, including:
  - use of colours, fonts, images and icons
  - visual hierarchy and clarity of message
- techniques for testing data visualisations, including:
  - visual inspection of the appearance of the data visualisation
  - confirming that charts and graphs are representative of the data being visualised.

**Key Skills:**

- select, justify and apply functions, formats and conventions to create effective data visualisations
- develop and apply suitable testing techniques to software tools used.
